# MCTA 3371 Mini Project GUI: Genetic Algorithm and Fuzzy Logic

## Overview

This project is a mini application that combines Genetic Algorithms and Fuzzy Logic to etc etc

## Components

### GUI (PyQt5)

The GUI is implemented using PyQt5, a set of Python bindings for Qt libraries. It includes input boxes for users to specify parameters and a Matplotlib canvas to visualize the results.

### Genetic Algorithm

The Genetic Algorithm is responsible for evolving a population of potential solutions to the knapsack problem over several generations. It includes parameters such as population size, mutation rate, and crossover rate.

### Fuzzy Logic

The Fuzzy Logic component introduces a degree of uncertainty into the decision-making process. In this context, it provides a fuzzy input and output based on the genetic algorithm's results.

### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is used for plotting the results. The Matplotlib canvas dynamically updates to reflect the output of the Genetic Algorithm and Fuzzy Logic.
